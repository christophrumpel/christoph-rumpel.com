            <h1>The Tools That Help Me Create</h1>

            <p>This is my current development setup which includes all the hard- and software I need for my daily work as a web developer and content creator.</p>

            <h3>Laptop</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MacBook Air (M1, 2020)</li>
                <li>Apple M1</li>
                <li>16 GB</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mouse / Keyboard</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Apple Bluetooth Keyboard</li>
                <li>Apple Magic Mouse 2</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Laptop Stand</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Griffin Elevator</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Display</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>LG UltraFine 5K Display</li>
                <li>It gets charged through the USB-C connection</li>
                <li>I was looking for a cheaper option, but none of them had a beautiful clean design</li>
                <li>I didn't regret it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Desk Frame</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully Jarvis Frame Only</li>
                <li>DIY adjustable height</li>
                <li>Save different height settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since I spent hours sitting in front of a computer every day, a standing desk was on my list for a long
                time. Since I moved last year, I finally had the chance and place to get one. I did a lot of research,
                and I'm super happy with my choice. For me, it was important that I only get the frame so that I can use
                a custom top.</p>

            <h3>Desk Top</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Custom Top</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I needed a custom top for my desk to fit a niche in my office room. I didn't find one to buy, so I decided to give it a try myself. I had no experience with woodworking so far, so I watched a lot of youtube videos and talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/gonedark">Jason
                    McCreary</a>, who is more experienced with that kind of work. In <a
                    href="/2020/6/my-custom-wooden-desk-top">this post</a>, I share some images of the process building the desk top.</p>

            <h3>Chair</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/omega-series#omega_2020_softweave-charcoal_blue">Secretlab OMEGA</a></li>
                <li>Charcoal Blue SoftWeaveÂ® Fabric</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During the cyber week in December 2019, there was a good deal for this chair. I wasn't sure if I should try a gaming chair, but I'm pretty satisfied. Especially the pillows for your head and back are
                comfortable and support your body.</p>

            <h3>Operating System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MacOS latest version</li>
            </ul>

                <li><a href="https://rectangleapp.com/">Rectanlge</a> is my app of choice</li>
                <li>
                    It lets you use the shortcuts of <code>Spectacle</code> if you had used that before like I did

                <li>With <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a> I customize the icons in the top menu</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A lot of those icons you don't need regularly. So with Bartender, you can hide them and
                everything looks a little more cleaned up.</p>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_bartender.png') }}" alt="Bartender app inactive">
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_bartender_active.png') }}" alt="Bartender app active">

            <h2 id="recording">Recording & Streaming</h2>
            <h3>Microphone</h3>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_mic_21.jpg') }}" alt="The Shure MV7 microphone">
            <ul>
                <li>Shure MV7 USB Podcast Microphone</li>
                <li>I use the pop filter of the Shure SM7B which is better</li>
                <li>Blue Compass microphone arm</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="post-markdown-styles">Before the Shure microphone, I was using the HyperX QuadCast. It was a good microphone, but I wanted to level up my audio game without investing ~$1.000 in the Shure SM7B. (which is currently the standard for a high-quality microphone) <br /><br />
                The <code>MV7 ist like the little brother of the SM7B</code> and it supports both USB and XLR. I have it connected to the Elgato Wave XLR audio interface.
            </p>

            <h3>Lights</h3>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_stream_image.jpg') }}" alt="Screenshot of Christoph's stream with his face">
            <ul>
                <li>2x Elgato Key Light Air</li>
                <li>They are mounted to the wall, so I don't have them on my desk.</li>
                <li>Philips Hue lights in the background</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I regularly have video calls, and I decided to level up my video quality. Light is an essential factor of that, and so I bought the Elgato Key Light Air. I first had the more significant Elgato key Light, which is also more powerful. The downside is it comes only with a
                mounting system which didn't fit my desk. So I switched to the smaller Light version, which is also more beautiful. I like it a lot.</p>

            <h3>Streaming Software</h3>
            <img class="blogimage" alt="Ecamm Live in action screenshot" src="/images/pages/uses_stream_app.png" />

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/?fp_ref=christoph93">Ecamm Live</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Before Ecamm Live, I was using StreamYard. I still recommend <a href="https://streamyard.com">StreamYard</a> to everyone who wants a quick start into the streaming world. It just works through your browser and is very simple to set up. I  also wrote a blog post about my <a href="https://christoph-rumpel.com/2021/4/what-I-learned-from-my-first-12-live-streams">whole streaming setup and experience.</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Editing Software</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Podcast - <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">Screenflow</a></li>
                <li>Video Course - <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">Screenflow</a></li>
                <li>Private video editing - <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/at/products/davinciresolve/">DaVinci
                        Resolve (free)</a></li>
            </ul>
