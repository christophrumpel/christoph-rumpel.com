            <h1>The Tools That Help Me Create</h1>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_desk_side.jpg') }}" alt="Christoph's working desk">


            <p>This is my current development setup which includes all the hard- and software I need for my daily work as a web developer and content creator.</p>

            <h3>Laptop</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MacBook Air (M1, 2020)</li>
                <li>Apple M1</li>
                <li>16 GB</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mouse / Keyboard</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Apple Bluetooth Keyboard</li>
                <li>Apple Magic Mouse 2</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Laptop Stand</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Griffin Elevator</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Display</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>LG UltraFine 5K Display</li>
                <li>It gets powered through the USB-C connection</li>
                <li>I was looking for a cheaper option, but none of them had a beautiful clean design</li>
                <li>I didn't regret it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Desk Frame</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully Jarvis Frame Only</li>
                <li>DIY adjustable height</li>
                <li>Save different height settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since I spent hours sitting in front of a computer every day, a standing desk was on my list for a long
                time. Since I moved last year, I finally had the chance and place to get one. I did a lot of research,
                and I'm super happy with my choice. For me, it was important that I only get the frame so that I can use
                a custom top.</p>

            <h3>Desk Top</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Custom Top</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I needed a custom top for my desk to fit a niche in my office room. I didn't find one to buy, so I decided to give it a try myself. I had no experience with woodworking so far, so I watched a lot of youtube videos and talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/gonedark">Jason
                    McCreary</a>, who is more experienced with that kind of work. In <a
                    href="/2020/6/my-custom-wooden-desk-top">this post</a>, I share some images of the process building the desk top.</p>

            <h3>Chair</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/omega-series#omega_2020_softweave-charcoal_blue">Secretlab OMEGA</a></li>
                <li>Charcoal Blue SoftWeave® Fabric</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During the cyber week in December 2019, there was a good deal for this chair. I wasn't sure if I should try a gaming chair, but I'm pretty satisfied. Especially the pillows for your head and back are
                comfortable and support your body.</p>

            <h3>Operating System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MacOS latest version</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            <p>A lot of those icons you don't need regularly. So with Bartender, you can hide them and
                everything looks a little more cleaned up.</p>

            <h2 id="recording">Recording & Streaming</h2>
            <div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> In December 2021, I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hzXlLHYsmg" target="_blank">livestream</a> where I showcased my whole streaming setup. Give it a look if you prefer a visual demo.</div>
            <h3>Microphone</h3>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_mic_21.jpg') }}" alt="The Shure MV7 microphone">
            <ul>
                <li>Shure MV7 USB Podcast Microphone</li>
                <li>I use the pop filter of the Shure SM7B which is better</li>
                <li>Blue Compass microphone arm</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="post-markdown-styles">Before the Shure microphone, I was using the HyperX QuadCast. It was a good microphone, but I wanted to level up my audio game without investing ~$1.000 in the Shure SM7B. (which is currently the standard for a high-quality microphone) <br /><br />
                The <code>MV7 is like the little brother of the SM7B</code> and it supports both USB and XLR. I have it connected to the Elgato Wave XLR audio interface.
            </p>

            <h3>Camera</h3>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_camera.jpg') }}" alt="Sony A6400 camera mounted behind the desk">

            <ul>
                <li>Sony Alpha 6400</li>
                <li>Lens - Sigma 16mm 1.4</li>
                <li>Mounted over a Rode Psa1 microphone boom</li>
                <li>The camera is used as a webcam through <a href="https://www.elgato.com/de/cam-link-4k">the Elgaot Cam Link 4k</a></li>
                <li>As a backup, I also have a <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B088NWWSKN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">HDMI Video Capture Card</a></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> I'm facing lots of issues with the Elgato Cam Link 4K where it freezes and can't be used anymore. That's why I need the backup capture card. This one is not capable of 4K though.</div>


            <h3>Lights</h3>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_stream_image.jpg') }}" alt="Screenshot of Christoph's stream with his face">
            <ul>
                <li>2x Elgato Key Light Air</li>
                <li>They are mounted to the wall, so I don't have them on my desk.</li>
                <li>Philips Hue lights in the background</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I regularly have video calls, and I decided to level up my video quality. Light is an essential factor of that, and so I bought the Elgato Key Light Air. I first had the more significant Elgato key Light, which is also more powerful. The downside is it comes only with a
                mounting system which didn't fit my desk. So I switched to the smaller Light version, which is also more beautiful. I like it a lot.</p>

            <h3>Streaming Software</h3>
            <img class="blogimage" alt="Ecamm Live in action screenshot" src="/images/pages/uses_stream_app.png" />

            </ul>

            <p>Before Ecamm Live, I was using StreamYard. I still recommend <a href="https://streamyard.com">StreamYard</a> to everyone who wants a quick start into the streaming world. It just works through your browser and is very simple to set up. I  also wrote a blog post about my <a href="https://christoph-rumpel.com/2021/4/what-I-learned-from-my-first-12-live-streams">whole streaming setup and experience.</a>
            </p>

            <p>That's my current setup. It has come a long way and is still changing every year. If you feel like I'm missing any important tools I didn't mention, please <a
