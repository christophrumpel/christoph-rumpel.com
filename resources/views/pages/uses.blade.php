            <p>This is my current development setup which includes all the hard- and software I need for my daily work as a web developer and content creator.</p>

            <h2 id="general">General</h2>

            <h3>Laptop</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021)</li>
                <li>Apple M1 Max</li>
                <li>32 GB</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mouse / Keyboard</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keychron K3</li>
                <li>Apple Magic Mouse 2</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Laptop Stand</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Griffin Elevator</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Display</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3VFUVPk">Apple Studio Display</a></li>
                <li>It gets powered through the USB-C connection</li>
                <li>I was looking for a cheaper option, but none of them had a beautiful clean design</li>
                <li>I didn't regret it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Desk Frame</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully Jarvis Frame Only</li>
                <li>DIY adjustable height</li>
                <li>Save different height settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since I spent hours sitting in front of a computer every day, a standing desk was on my list for a long
                time. Since I moved last year, I finally had the chance and place to get one. I did a lot of research,
                and I'm super happy with my choice. For me, it was important that I only get the frame so that I can use
                a custom top.</p>

            <h3>Desk Top</h3>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_table.jpg') }}" alt="Christoph's working desk">
            <ul>
                <li>Custom Top</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I needed a custom top for my desk to fit a niche in my office room. I didn't find one to buy, so I decided to give it a try myself. I had no experience with woodworking so far, so I watched a lot of youtube videos and talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/gonedark">Jason
                    McCreary</a>, who is more experienced with that kind of work. In <a
                    href="/2020/6/my-custom-wooden-desk-top">this post</a>, I share some images of the process building the desk top.</p>

            <h3>Chair</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/omega-series#omega_2020_softweave-charcoal_blue">Secretlab OMEGA</a></li>
                <li>Charcoal Blue SoftWeave® Fabric</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During the cyber week in December 2019, there was a good deal for this chair. I wasn't sure if I should try a gaming chair, but I'm pretty satisfied. Especially the pillows for your head and back are
                comfortable and support your body.</p>

            <h3>Operating System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MacOS latest version</li>
