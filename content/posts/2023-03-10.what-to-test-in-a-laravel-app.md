## Test Page Responses

Testing page responses in a Laravel application
involves sending a request to a specific URL and
then asserting that the response matches the
expected output. This can help ensure that the
pages in your application are rendering correctly
and that the data being displayed is accurate.

Testing page responses is useful because it can
catch errors that may not be apparent during
development, such as missing data or broken links.
It can also help ensure that your application is
functioning as expected after changes or updates
are made.

Here's an example of how you can test page
responses using the PEST testing framework:

```php
it('displays the correct page title', function () {
    $response = $this->get('/about');
    
    $response->assertStatus(200)
        ->assertSee('About Us');
});
```

## Test Shown Text On A Page

Testing that specific text appears on a page in a Laravel application involves sending a request to a specific URL and then asserting that the response contains the expected text. This can help ensure that the correct data is being displayed on the page and that there are no issues with the application's data retrieval or rendering.

Testing for specific text is useful because it allows you to verify that the page is displaying the expected content, and can help identify issues with data retrieval, rendering or logic.

Here's an example of how you can test for specific text using the PEST testing framework:

```php
it('displays the correct product name', function () {
    $product = Product::create([
        'name' => 'Laravel Book',
        'description' => 'A book about the Laravel framework',
        'price' => 29.99
    ]);

    $response = $this->get('/products/'.$product->id);

    $response->assertSee('Laravel Book');
});
```
