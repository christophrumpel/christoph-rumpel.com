Be aware that some examples are simplified, to emphasize the shown concept.

Looking for something specific? Pick it:

* [Testing Page Responses](#testing-page-responses)
* [Testing Shown Text On A Page](#testing-shown-text)
* [Testing Models / Relationships](#testing-models)
* [Testing Jobs & Queues](#testing-jobs-queues)
* [Testing Mails](#testing-mails)
<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> All examples can also be found on the dedicated <a href="https://github.com/christophrumpel/what-you-can-test-in-laravel">repository</a>. </div>


<h2 id="testing-page-responses">Testing Page Responses</h2>

Testing page response is one of the simplest tests to write; still, it is extremely useful.

It makes sure a page responds with the correct HTTP status code, primarily a 200 response.

```php
it('gives back a successful response for home page', function () {
    $this->get('/')->assertOk();
});
```

It's a straightforward test, but it is crucial to know your home page does not throw an error. So, if you want to write your first test, this is the one to start with.

<h2 id="testing-shown-text">Testing Shown Text On A Page</h2>

This test is similar to the first page response test. We also test the response, but this time we are interested in the content of the response.

```php
it('lists products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $firstProduct = Product::factory()->create();
    $secondProduct = Product::factory()->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertSeeText([
            $firstProduct->title,
            $secondProduct->title,
        ]);
});
```

Here we are ensuring we see our product titles on the home page. This is useful if you load the products from the database and ensure they are shown.

Here you also can be more specific, like when you only want to show `released products`.

```php
it('lists released products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $releasedProduct = Product::factory()
        ->released()
        ->create();
        
    $draftProduct = Product::factory()
        ->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertSeeText($releasedProduct->title)
        ->assertDontSeeText($draftProduct->title);
});
```

It also demos how to test something that is not shown, which can be helpful too.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> This test wouldn't be that helpful if we only have static text on the home page.</div>

<h2 id="testing-models">Testing Models / Relationships</h2>

First, I like to test every relationship of a model. To be precise, we do `not` want to test the functionality of the relationship; this is what Laravel already does. We want to make sure that relationships are defined.

```php
it('has products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()
        ->has(Product::factory())
        ->create();

    // Act
    $products = $user->products;

    // Assert
    expect($products)
        ->toBeInstanceOf(Collection::class)
        ->first()->toBeInstanceOf(Product::class);
});
```

Developers have different opinions about what logic should be handled in a model, and that's ok. But if you add it, make sure also to test it.

```php
it('only returns released courses for query scope', function () {
    // Arrange
    Course::factory()->released()->create();
    Course::factory()->create();

    // Act && Assert
    expect(Course::released()->get())
        ->toHaveCount(1)
        ->first()->id->toEqual(1);
});
```

Another example would be a model accessor like:

```php
protected function firstName(): Attribute
    {
        return Attribute::make(
            get: fn (string $value) => ucfirst($value),
        );
    }
```

And the test would look like this:

```php
it('capitalizes the first character of the first name', function () {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()->create(['first_name' => 'christoph'])

    // Act && Assert
    expect($user->first_name)
        ->toBe('Christoph');
});
```

<h2 id="testing-mails">Testing Mails</h2>

Laravel provides a lot of testing helpers, especially when using Facades.

```php
class PublishPodcastController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(Podcast $podcast)
    {
        // publish podcast

        Mail::to($podcast->author)->send(new PodcastPublishedMail());
    }
}
```

At the end of this controller, we are sending an email. In our test, we can hit the controller through an endpoint and make sure this email `would have been` sent.

```php
it('sends email to podcast author', function() {
    // Arrange
    Mail::fake();
    $podcast = Podcast::factory()->create();

    // Act
    $this->post(route('publish-podcast', $podcast));

   // Assert
    Mail::assertSent(PodcastPublishedMail::class);
});
```

Always run the `Mail::fake()` method at the beginning of your tests when testing emails. This makes sure no actual email is being sent to a user.

Most helper methods like `assertSent` also accept a callback as the second argument. In our case, it receives the mailable object. It contains all the email data, like the email to which it needs to be sent.

This allows you to make even more assertions, like about the `to-address´ of the email.

```php
Mail::assertSent(PodcastPublishedMail::class, function(PodcastPublishedMail $mail) use ($podcast) {
        return $mail->hasTo($podcast->author->email);
    });
```

<h2 id="testing-jobs-queues">Testing Jobs & Queues</h2>

I like to test jobs and queues separately, starting from the outside. This means I test a job is being pushed to a queue.

```php
it('dispatches an import products job', function () {
    // Arrange
    Queue::fake();

    // Act
    $this->post('import');

    // Assert
    Queue::assertPushed(ImportProductsJob::class);
});
```

This ensures that my job will be pushed to the queue for a specific trigger, like hitting an endpoint. Again, the `Queue::fake()` takes care of not pushing a job. We do not want to run the job at this point.

But we still have to test the job, right? Of course. It contains the crucial logic of this feature:

```php
it('imports products', function() {
   
    // Act
    (new ImportProductsJob)->handle();

    // Assert
    $this->assertDatabaseCount(Product::class, 50);
    
    // Make more assertions about the imported data
})
```

This new test concentrates on the job and what it should do. We trigger the job directly by calling the `handle` on it, which every job has.

## Conclusion

It is important to create a list in your head about all the things you like to test in your applications. Of course, when learning new coding concepts, you will also need to learn new testing techniques. So your list will grow over time.
