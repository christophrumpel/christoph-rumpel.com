After writing about my coding year in [2015](https://christoph-rumpel.com/2015/12/what-I-learned-in-2015), [2016](https://christoph-rumpel.com/2016/12/My-coding-year-2016), [2017](https://christoph-rumpel.com/2017/12/my-coding-year-2017), [2018](https://christoph-rumpel.com/2018/12/my-coding-year-2018) and [2019](https://christoph-rumpel.com/2020/01/my-coding-year-2019), this is now my sixths year in review article. I love to see that so many others started to write about their years as well. I think this is a great insight and helps both the readers and the authors.
