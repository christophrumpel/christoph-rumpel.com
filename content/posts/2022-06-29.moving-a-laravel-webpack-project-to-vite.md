[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is the `Next Generation Frontend Tooling,` which is Laravel's default from now on.

The [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/vite) contains an entire section explaining how it works and how to use it. But most of us are more interested in using it in an `existing project.` So that's what this post is for.

## Dependencies

We need to install two new dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vite laravel-vite-plugin
```

Also, the `scripts` section of our `package.json` file will change due to the new Vite scripts.

```js
"scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build"
},
```

That's all we need for the scripts.

Since Vite is a replacement for webpack, we can remove the `laravel-mix` dependency and delete the `webpack.mix.js` file from our application.

```bash
npm remove laravel-mix && rm webpack.mix.js
```

Your `package.json` file will now look something like this:

```json
    "private": true,
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "vite build"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "axios": "^0.25",
        "laravel-vite-plugin": "^0.2.1",
        "lodash": "^4.17.19",
        "postcss": "^8.4.14",
        "postcss-import": "^14.0.1",
        "vite": "^2.9.11",
    }
}
```

## Vite Configuration

Now we need to set up Vite. Therefore create a new `vite.config.js` file in the root of your Laravel application.

```js
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin'
import {defineConfig} from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel([
            'resources/css/app.css',
            'resources/js/app.js',
        ]),
    ],
});
```

This is where we use the `vite` and `laravel-vite-plugin` packages, and we also define our asset paths.

## Using Vite In Your Templates

In the `head` of your template files, we have to load the assets through the new `@vite` blade directive.

```html
@vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])
```

You don't need to use `mix` or load them manually anymore.

## Running Vite

To run Vite, you use the npm script `npm run dev,` which we have defined, which is just an alias for `npm run vite.`

It will compile your assets lighting fast! To make your assets production-ready, you can use the new `npm run build` script to version and bundle your assets.

## Using Tailwind CSS

If you use Tailwind CSS in your Laravel project, your styles won't work. That's because we need `Post CSS` for Tailwind CSS.

Create a `postcss.config.js` file, if you haven't already, and define two plugins there:

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: {
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    },
};
```

You also need to have those packages installed, but if you already use Tailwind CSS, you should have them already.

Vite will look for the PostCSS configuration and automatically apply it if given. That's already it. Your Tailwind CSS styles should now work too.

## Auto-Refresh Templates On Change

One of Vite's most prominent features is `Hot Module Replacement` for Vue.js and React.

But it's also great for refreshing a browser after file changes. By default, this is not working with `Blade` files, but [Freek and Spatie](https://freek.dev/2277-using-laravel-vite-to-automatically-refresh-your-browser-when-changing-a-blade-file) got a working solution.

Just update your Vite configuration with a custom plugin named `blade` here:

```json
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin'
import {defineConfig} from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel([
            'resources/css/app.css',
            'resources/js/app.js',
        ]),
        {
            name: 'blade',
            handleHotUpdate({ file, server }) {
                if (file.endsWith('.blade.php')) {
                    server.ws.send({
                        type: 'full-reload',
                        path: '*',
                    });
                }
            },
        }
    ],
});
```

This is enough to refresh your browser after a blade file is changing. And again, this happens lightning fast!

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Blocking

Some browsers, like Brave, block Vite's request by default. You will see those errors in your browser console. This can prevent Vite from compiling your assets. So make sure to check your browser if you see blocking-request errors.

### HTTPS and Valet

You may also run an issue if you are running `Laravel Valet` locally with `HTTPS` secured sites. But, again, [Freek](https://freek.dev/2276-making-vite-and-valet-play-nice-together) already found a solution.

## Successful Public Pull Requests

It may help you to see how others have already successfully moved their Laravel projects to Vite:

* Laravel.io [https://github.com/laravelio/laravel.io/pull/882](https://github.com/laravelio/laravel.io/pull/882)

## Conclusion

I like Vite a lot, and I hope this guide can help you switch from an existing Laravel project faster. Did I miss something? Please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christophrumpel).
