All test examples are written with the testing framework [PEST](https://pestphp.com). Still, a lot will be very similar to PHPUnit, and the focus is on the testing concepts.

Looking for something specific? Pick it:

* [Testing Page Response Status](#testing-page-response-status)
* [Testing Page Response Text](#testing-page-response-text)
* [Testing Page Response JSON](#testing-page-response-json)
* [Testing Against The Database](#testing-database)
* [Testing Validation](#testing-validation)
* [Testing Models / Relationships](#testing-models)
* [Testing Mails](#testing-mails)
* [Testing Jobs & Queues](#testing-jobs-queues)
* [Testing Actions](#testing-actions)
* [Testing Exceptions](#testing-exceptions)
* [Mocking Dependencies](#mocking-dependencies)

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> All examples can also be found on the dedicated <a href="https://github.com/christophrumpel/what-you-can-test-in-laravel">repository</a>. </div>


<h2 id="testing-page-response-status">Testing Page Response Status</h2>

Testing page response is one of the simplest tests to write; still, it is extremely useful.

It makes sure a page responds with the correct HTTP status code, primarily a 200 response.

```php
it('gives back a successful response for home page', function () {
    $this->get('/')->assertOk();
});
```

It's a straightforward test, but it is crucial to know your home page does not throw an error. So, if you want to write your first test, this is the one to start with.

<h2 id="testing-page-response-text">Testing Page Response Text</h2>

This test is similar to the first page response test. We also test the response, but this time we are interested in the content of the response.

```php
it('lists products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $firstProduct = Product::factory()->create();
    $secondProduct = Product::factory()->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertSeeText([
            $firstProduct->title,
            $secondProduct->title,
        ]);
});
```

Here we are ensuring we see our product titles on the home page. This is useful if you load the products from the database and ensure they are shown.

Here you also can be more specific, like when you only want to show `released products`.

```php
it('lists released products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $releasedProduct = Product::factory()
        ->released()
        ->create();
        
    $draftProduct = Product::factory()
        ->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertSeeText($releasedProduct->title)
        ->assertDontSeeText($draftProduct->title);
});
```

It also demos how to test something that is not shown, which can be helpful too.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> This test wouldn't be that helpful if we only have static text on the home page.</div>

<h2 id="testing-page-response-json">Testing Page Response JSON</h2>

Often you want to return JSON data from your API. This is where you can use Laravel's JSON helpers, like the `assertJson` method.

```php
it('returns all products as JSON', function () {
    // Arrange
    $product = Product::factory()->create();
    $anotherProduct = Product::factory()->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->post('api/products')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertJson([
            [
                'title' => $product->title,
                'description' => $product->description,
            ],
            [
                'title' => $anotherProduct->title,
                'description' => $anotherProduct->description,
            ],
        ]);
});
```

<h2 id="testing-database">Testing Against The Database</h2>

Since we store data in the database, we want to make sure that data is stored correctly. This is where Laravel can help you with some handy assertion helpers.

```php
it('stores a product', function () {
    // Act
    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())
        ->post('product', [
        'title' => 'Product name',
        'description' => 'Product description',
    ])->assertSuccessful();

    // Assert
    $this->assertDatabaseCount(Product::class, 1);
    $this->assertDatabaseHas(Product::class, [
        'title' => 'Product name',
        'description' => 'Product description',
    ]);
});
```

The example ensures that a product is created and stored in the database for our post route.

<h2 id="testing-validation">Testing Validation</h2>

Validation is a crucial part of many applications. You want to make sure that only valid data can be submitted. By default, Laravel sends validation errors back to the user, which we can check with the `assertInvalid` method.

```php
it('requires the title', function () {
    // Act
    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())
        ->post('product', [
            'description' => 'Product description',
        ])->assertInvalid(['title' => 'required']);
});

it('requires the description', function () {
    // Act
    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())
        ->post('product', [
            'title' => 'Product name',
        ])->assertInvalid(['description' => 'required']);
});
```

When dealing with many validation rules, using [datasets](https://pestphp.com/docs/datasets) can be helpful. This can clean up your tests a lot.

<h2 id="testing-models">Testing Models / Relationships</h2>

First, I like to test every relationship of a model. To be precise, we do `not` want to test the functionality of the relationship; this is what Laravel already does. We want to make sure that relationships are defined.

```php
it('has products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()
        ->has(Product::factory())
        ->create();

    // Act
    $products = $user->products;

    // Assert
    expect($products)
        ->toBeInstanceOf(Collection::class)
        ->first()->toBeInstanceOf(Product::class);
});
```

Developers have different opinions about what logic should be handled in a model, and that's ok. But if you add it, make sure also to test it.

```php
it('only returns released courses for query scope', function () {
    // Arrange
    Course::factory()->released()->create();
    Course::factory()->create();

    // Act && Assert
    expect(Course::released()->get())
        ->toHaveCount(1)
        ->first()->id->toEqual(1);
});
```

Another example would be a model accessor like:

```php
protected function firstName(): Attribute
    {
        return Attribute::make(
            get: fn (string $value) => ucfirst($value),
        );
    }
```

And the test would look like this:

```php
it('capitalizes the first character of the first name', function () {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()->create(['first_name' => 'christoph'])

    // Act && Assert
    expect($user->first_name)
        ->toBe('Christoph');
});
```

<h2 id="testing-mails">Testing Mails</h2>

Laravel provides a lot of testing helpers, especially when using Facades.

```php
class PublishPodcastController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(Podcast $podcast)
    {
        // publish podcast

        Mail::to($podcast->author)->send(new PodcastPublishedMail());
    }
}
```

At the end of this controller, we are sending an email. In our test, we can hit the controller through an endpoint and make sure this email `would have been` sent.

```php
it('sends email to podcast author', function() {
    // Arrange
    Mail::fake();
    $podcast = Podcast::factory()->create();

    // Act
    $this->post(route('publish-podcast', $podcast));

   // Assert
    Mail::assertSent(PodcastPublishedMail::class);
});
```

Always run the `Mail::fake()` method at the beginning of your tests when testing emails. This makes sure no actual email is being sent to a user.

Most helper methods like `assertSent` also accept a callback as the second argument. In our case, it receives the mailable object. It contains all the email data, like the email to which it needs to be sent.

This allows you to make even more assertions, like about the `to-addressÂ´ of the email.

```php
Mail::assertSent(PodcastPublishedMail::class, function(PodcastPublishedMail $mail) use ($podcast) {
        return $mail->hasTo($podcast->author->email);
    });
```

<h2 id="testing-jobs-queues">Testing Jobs & Queues</h2>

I like to test jobs and queues separately, starting from the outside. This means I test a job is being pushed to a queue.

```php
it('dispatches an import products job', function () {
    // Arrange
    Queue::fake();

    // Act
    $this->post('import');

    // Assert
    Queue::assertPushed(ImportProductsJob::class);
});
```

This ensures that my job will be pushed to the queue for a specific trigger, like hitting an endpoint. Again, the `Queue::fake()` takes care of not pushing a job. We do not want to run the job at this point.

But we still have to test the job, right? Of course. It contains the crucial logic of this feature:

```php
it('imports products', function() {
   
    // Act
    (new ImportProductsJob)->handle();

    // Assert
    $this->assertDatabaseCount(Product::class, 50);
    
    // Make more assertions about the imported data
})
```

This new test concentrates on the job and what it should do. We trigger the job directly by calling the `handle` on it, which every job has.

<h2 id="testing-actions">Testing Actions</h2>

Actions are just simple classes that have one specific job. They are a great way to organize your code, and separate your logic from your controllers to keep them clean. But how do you test them?

Let's start again from the outside. First, we want to test that our action is called when hitting a specific endpoint.

```php
it('calls add-product-to-user action', function () {
    // Assert
    $this->mock(AddProductToUserAction::class)
        ->shouldReceive('handle')
        ->atLeast()->once();

    // Arrange
    $product = Product::factory()->create();
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    // Act
    $this->post("purchase/$user->id/$product->i");
});
```

We can do this by mocking our action class and expecting that the handle method is called. But, again, we are here not interested in what our action does; we want to make sure it is called when we hit our purchase controller.

To make this work, we must ensure that the container resolves our action.

```php
class PurchaseController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(User $user, Product $product): void
    {
        app(AddProductToUserAction::class->handle($user, $product);

        // Send purchase success email, etc.
    }
}
```

Then we can also test the action itself. Like a job, we call the `handle` method to trigger the action.

```php
it('adds product to user', function () {
    // Arrange
    $product = Product::factory()->create();
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    // Act
    (new AddProductToUserAction())->handle($user, $product);

    // Assert
    expect($user->products)
        ->toHaveCount(1)
        ->first()->id->toEqual($product->id);
});
```

<h2 id="testing-exceptions">Testing Exceptions</h2>

Sometimes it is a good thing when an exception is thrown because we intentionally want to stop the execution of our code. We can test that too.

```php
it('stops if at least one account not found', function () {
    // Act
    $this->artisan(MergeAccountsCommand::class, [
        'userId' => 1,
        'userToBeMergedId' => 2,
    ]);
})->throws(ModelNotFoundException::class);
```

We can chain the `throws` method to our test in PEST. This will make sure that the exception is thrown.

<h2 id="mocking-dependencies">Mocking Dependencies</h2>

When working with code with dependencies, it can be helpful to mock them. This will let you concentrate on the logic of your code and not on the dependencies.

We already did that when testing our [action classes](#testing-actions), but this works with any dependency. In the following example, we have a controller with two dependencies: a payment provider and a mailer.

```php
class PaymentController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(PaymentProvider $paymentProvider, Mailer $mailer)
    {
        $paymentProvider->handle();

        $mailer->to(auth()->user())->send(new PaymentSuccessfulMail);
    }
}
```

In our test, we want to focus on testing that the correct email is being sent. That's why we can mock the payment provider and expect the `handle` method to be called. As a result, our test will not fail, even though the actual payment provider is never called.

```php
it('sends payment successful mail', function () {
    // Arrange
    Mail::fake();

    // Expect
    $this->mock(PaymentProvider::class)
        ->shouldReceive('handle')
        ->once();

    // Act
    $this->post('payment');

    // Assert
    Mail::assertSent(PaymentSuccessfulMail::class);
});
```


## Conclusion

Creating a list in your head of everything you like to test in your applications is essential. But, of course, when learning new coding concepts, you must also learn new testing techniques. So your list will grow over time.
