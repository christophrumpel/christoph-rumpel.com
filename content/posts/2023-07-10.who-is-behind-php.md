title: Who Is Behind PHP
categories: php
summary: "PHP is a programming language that powers the web. It is used by 77.4% of all the websites that use a server-side programming language. Especially in the last years, PHP has grown to be a very mature language that provides many features and is used by many big companies. But who is behind PHP? Who is creating new features and decides what will be in the next version? What is this \"core team\" or the \"internals\" you might have heard of? In this article, we are going to answer these questions."

## History Lesson

Before discussing the current state, we must consider where it comes from. PHP was `created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994`. He created PHP to be able to track visitors to his online resume. He called it `Personal Home Page Tools`. In 1995, he released the source code of PHP. Since then, it has been rewritten a few times and got a lot of new features.

## Who Owns PHP?

PHP is an `open-source project`. This means the source code is available for everyone to read and modify. Still, the same is the case with many projects; one person is primarily behind in making the final decision.

With PHP, it is a bit complicated. There is no single person that owns PHP. Instead, a group of people are allowed to vote on new features and changes. This group is often referred to as `the core team`. The core team comprises people who have been contributing to PHP for a long time and have proven that they know what they are doing. The core team is responsible for developing PHP and decides what will be in the next version.

You can also say that everyone with an account on [php.net](https://php.net) is part of the core team. In fact, over `1.700` people are theoretically allowed to vote. ü§Ø

## How Does Voting Work?

Before a new feature can be added to PHP, it has to be discussed. This discussion happens on the [PHP Internals mailing list](https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php).

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> This is also where the name "Internals" comes from.</div>

Despite the public's belief, `everyone can join this mailing list` and discuss new features. Once a feature is ready to be voted on, the person behind the idea must create an RFC. (Request For Comments)

An `RFC` is a document that describes the feature and why it should be added to PHP. It also contains a list of pros and cons and a list of alternatives. The RFC is then discussed on the mailing list.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> Everyone is allowed to create an RFC. You do not have to be a member.</div>

A vote makes the final decision. Every PHP.net member is allowed to vote. The voting period is two weeks. It is accepted if the RFC gets at least 50% of the votes. It is rejected if it gets less than 50% of the votes.

## RFC Process Example

Here is an example of the RFC process for `Interface Default Methods`.

First, there was a discussion about it on the internals mailing list. The best way to follow the discussion of the internal mailing list is a service called [externals.io](https://externals.io/). It is a website that collects all the emails from the mailing list and displays them in a friendly way. (Thank you, [Matthieu](https://twitter.com/matthieunapoli) üôè)

The discussion about the "Interface Default Methods" can be found [here](https://externals.io/message/120582#120582). In this case, the discussion was already about a given RFC. But it is also possible to start a conversation without an RFC.

There was also [communication](https://externals.io/message/120725#120735) about the vote of the RFC. The voting result was added to the  [Interface Defaults RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/interface-default-methods).

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot of a vote for an Interface Method Defaults RFC" src="/images/blog/2023/behind_php_vote.png" />

This RFC was rejected: 10 people voted for it, and 13 voted against it.

## How To Become A Member Of The Core Team?

You become a core team member when you receive a PHP.net account. To get one, you must submit a `Karma Request`. This means you are asking the core team for an account too.

The core team will then discuss your request and decide if you can get an account. If you can get an account, you will be added to the core team and can vote on upcoming RFCs.

## Do Developers Get Paid For Working On PHP?

The short answer is: No. The long answer is: It depends.

Throughout the history of PHP, there have always been companies that paid developers to work on PHP. In the early days, it was mainly Rasmus Lerdorf himself. Later, companies like Zend, Microsoft, and Facebook started to pay developers to work on PHP.

In 2019, JetBrains hired Nikita Popov to work on PHP for a long time. He is one of the most active contributors to PHP and has been working on PHP for over ten years. Unfortunately, in 2021, he left JetBrains and PHP and is now focusing on other things.

JetBrains is also the company that started the [PHP Foundation](https://php.foundation/). The PHP Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to the PHP project. JetBrains, other companies, and individuals fund it.

Currently, the PHP Foundation is sponsoring six people to work on PHP:

- [Derick Rethans](https://twitter.com/derickr/)
- [George Peter Banyard](https://twitter.com/Girgias)
- [Ilija Tovilo](https://twitter.com/IlijaTovilo)
- [Jakub Zelenka](https://github.com/bukka)
- [Mate Kocsis](https://twitter.com/kocsismate90)
- [Arnoud Le Blanc](https://twitter.com/arnaud_lb)

Paying those developers to work on PHP is possible due to donations. The PHP Foundation is accepting donations from companies and individuals. If you want to support the development of PHP, you can donate [here](https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation/contribute/backers-34283/checkout).

## Conclusion

As you can see, PHP has come a long way, and it is impressive how it is still evolving despite some debts from the past.

It isn't easy to shape a project as big as PHP, especially where no single person makes final decisions. That's why it is often unclear to the outside world why certain choices are made and who made them. I hope the PHP Foundation can help make this more transparent in the future.

Next to the PHP language itself, we need a working infrastructure around it to keep it thriving. `I love PHP,` and I want to see it grow and evolve.

I hope this article gave you some insights on how PHP is developed and who is behind it. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christophrumpel).
