<h2 id="testing-page-response-status">Testing Page
Response Status</h2>

Testing page response is one of the simplest tests
to write; still, it is extremely useful.

It makes sure a page responds with the correct
HTTP status code, primarily a 200 response.

```php
it('gives back a successful response for home page', function () {
    $this->get('/')->assertOk();
});
```

It's a straightforward test, but knowing your home page does not throw an error is crucial. So,
if you want to write your first test, this is the
one to start with.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Learn more about testing page responses on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/http-tests#response-assertions">official docs</a>. </div>

<h2 id="testing-page-response-text">Testing Page
Response Text</h2>

This test is similar to the first page response
test. We also test the response, but this time we
are interested in the content of the response.

```php
it('lists products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $firstProduct = Product::factory()->create();
    $secondProduct = Product::factory()->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertSeeTextInOrder([
            $firstProduct->title,
            $secondProduct->title,
        ]);
});
```

Here we are ensuring we see our product titles on
the home page. This is useful if you load the
products from the database and ensure they are
shown.

Here you also can be more specific, like when you
only want to show `released products`.

```php
it('lists released products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $releasedProduct = Product::factory()
        ->released()
        ->create();
        
    $draftProduct = Product::factory()
        ->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertSeeText($releasedProduct->title)
        ->assertDontSeeText($draftProduct->title);
});
```

It also demos how to test something that is not
shown, which can be helpful too. This test
wouldn't be that helpful if we only have static
text on the home page.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Learn more about testing page responses on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/http-tests#response-assertions">official docs</a>. </div>

<h2 id="testing-page-response-view">Testing Page
Response View</h2>

Next to testing the response status and content,
you can also test the view that is returned.

```php
it('returns correct view', function() {
    // Act & Assert
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertViewIs('home');
});
```

You can take this even further and test the data
that is passed to the view.

```php
it('returns correct view', function() {
    // Act & Assert
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertViewIs('home')
        ->assertViewHas('products');
});
```

<h2 id="testing-page-response-json">Testing Page
Response JSON</h2>

Often you want to return JSON data from your API.
This is where you can use Laravel's JSON helpers,
like the `assertJson` method.

```php
it('returns all products as JSON', function () {
    // Arrange
    $product = Product::factory()->create();
    $anotherProduct = Product::factory()->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->post('api/products')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertJson([
            [
                'title' => $product->title,
                'description' => $product->description,
            ],
            [
                'title' => $anotherProduct->title,
                'description' => $anotherProduct->description,
            ],
        ]);
});
```

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Learn more about testing page responses on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/http-tests#response-assertions">official docs</a>. </div>

<h2 id="testing-database">Testing Against The
Database</h2>

Since we store data in the database, we want to
make sure that data is stored correctly. This is
where Laravel can help you with some handy
assertion helpers.

```php
it('stores a product', function () {
    // Act
    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())
        ->post('product', [
        'title' => 'Product name',
        'description' => 'Product description',
    ])->assertSuccessful();

    // Assert
    $this->assertDatabaseCount(Product::class, 1);
    $this->assertDatabaseHas(Product::class, [
        'title' => 'Product name',
        'description' => 'Product description',
    ]);
});
```

The example ensures that a product is created and
stored in the database for our post route.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Find all database assertions on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/database-testing#available-assertions">official documentation</a>.</div>

<h2 id="testing-validation">Testing
Validation</h2>

Validation is a crucial part of many applications.
You want to make sure that only valid data can be
submitted. By default, Laravel sends validation
errors back to the user, which we can check with
the `assertInvalid` method.

```php
it('requires the title', function () {
    // Act
    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())
        ->post('product', [
            'description' => 'Product description',
        ])->assertInvalid(['title' => 'required']);
});

it('requires the description', function () {
    // Act
    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())
        ->post('product', [
            'title' => 'Product name',
        ])->assertInvalid(['description' => 'required']);
});
```

When dealing with many validation rules,
using [datasets](https://pestphp.com/docs/datasets)
can be pretty helpful. This can clean up your tests
a lot.

```php
it('requires title and description tested with a dataset', function($data, $error) {
    // Act
    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())
        ->post('product', $data)->assertInvalid($error);
})->with([
    'title required' => [['description' => 'text'], ['title' => 'required']],
    'description required' => [['title' => 'Title'], ['description' => 'required']],
]);
```

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Learn more about validation assertions on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/http-tests#response-assertions">official docs</a>. </div>

<h2 id="testing-models">Testing Models /
Relationships</h2>

First, I like to test every relationship of a
model. To be precise, we do `not` want to test the
functionality of the relationship; this is what
Laravel already does. We want to make sure that
relationships are defined.

```php
it('has products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()
        ->has(Product::factory())
        ->create();

    // Act
    $products = $user->products;

    // Assert
    expect($products)
        ->toBeInstanceOf(Collection::class)
        ->first()->toBeInstanceOf(Product::class);
});
```

Developers have different opinions about what
logic should be handled in a model, and that's ok.
But if you add it, make sure also to test it.

```php
it('only returns released courses for query scope', function () {
    // Arrange
    Course::factory()->released()->create();
    Course::factory()->create();

    // Act & Assert
    expect(Course::released()->get())
        ->toHaveCount(1)
        ->first()->id->toEqual(1);
});
```

Another example would be a model accessor like:

```php
protected function firstName(): Attribute
    {
        return Attribute::make(
            get: fn (string $value) => ucfirst($value),
        );
    }
```

And the test would look like this:

```php
it('capitalizes the first character of the first name', function () {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()->create(['first_name' => 'christoph'])

    // Act & Assert
    expect($user->first_name)
        ->toBe('Christoph');
});
```

<h2 id="testing-sending-mails">Testing Sending
Mails</h2>

Laravel provides a lot of testing helpers,
especially when using Facades.

```php
class PublishPodcastController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(Podcast $podcast)
    {
        // publish podcast
        // ...

        Mail::to($podcast->author)->send(new PodcastPublishedMail());
    }
}
```

At the end of this controller, we are sending an
email. In our test, we can hit the controller
through an endpoint and make sure this
email `would have been` sent.

```php
it('sends email to podcast author', function() {
    // Arrange
    Mail::fake();
    $podcast = Podcast::factory()->create();

    // Act
    $this->post(route('publish-podcast', $podcast));

   // Assert
    Mail::assertSent(PodcastPublishedMail::class);
});
```

Always run the `Mail::fake()` method at the
beginning of your tests when testing emails. This
makes sure no actual email is being sent to a
user.

Most helper methods like `assertSent` also accept
a callback as the second argument. In our case, it
receives the mailable object. It contains all the
email data, like the email to which it needs to be
sent.

This allows you to make even more assertions, like
about the `to-address´ of the email.

```php
Mail::assertSent(PodcastPublishedMail::class, function(PodcastPublishedMail $mail) use ($podcast) {
    return $mail->hasTo($podcast->author->email);
});
```

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Learn more about testing mailables on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/mail#testing-mailable-sending">official docs</a>. </div>

<h2 id="testing-mail-content">Testing Mail
Content</h2>

It also makes sense to test the content of an
email. This is especially useful when you have a
lot of emails in your application. You want to
make sure that the content is correct.

```php
it('contains the product title', function () {
    // Arrange
    $product = Product::factory()->make();

   // Act
    $mail = new PaymentSuccessfulMail($product);

    // Assert
    expect($mail)
        ->assertHasSubject('Your payment was successful')
        ->assertSeeInHtml($product->title);
});
```

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Learn about all the other assertions for testing mail content on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/mail#testing-mailable-content">official docs</a>. </div>

<h2 id="testing-jobs-queues">Testing Jobs &
Queues</h2>

I like to test jobs and queues separately,
starting from the outside. This means I test a job
is being pushed to a queue.

```php
it('dispatches an import products job', function () {
    // Arrange
    Queue::fake();

    // Act
    $this->post('import');

    // Assert
    Queue::assertPushed(ImportProductsJob::class);
});
```

This ensures that my job will be pushed to the
queue for a specific trigger, like hitting an
endpoint. Again, the `Queue::fake()` takes care of
not pushing a job. We do not want to run the job
at this point.

But we still have to test the job, right? Of
course. It contains the crucial logic of this
feature:

```php
it('imports products', function() {
   
    // Act
    (new ImportProductsJob)->handle();

    // Assert
    $this->assertDatabaseCount(Product::class, 50);
    
    // Make more assertions about the imported data
})
```

This new test concentrates on the job and what it
should do. We trigger the job directly by calling
the `handle` on it, which every job has.

<h2 id="testing-notifications">Testing
Notifications</h2>

Notifications are great for informing your users about
important events. Make sure to test them too:

```php
it('sends notification about new product', function () {
    // Arrange
    Notification::fake();
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    $product = Product::factory()->create();

    // Act
    $this->artisan(InformAboutNewProductNotification::class, [
        'productId' => $product->id,
        'userId' => $user->id,
    ]);

    // Assert
    Notification::assertSentTo(
        [$user], NewProductNotification::class
    );
});
```

In the example above, we test a
notification sent to a user when a new
product is created. We are using the `artisan`
method to trigger the notification. This is a
great way to test notifications triggered
by a command.

Again, there is a `fake` method for the notification
facade that makes sure no actual notification is
being sent.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Learn more about testing notifications on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/notifications#testing">official docs</a>. </div>

<h2 id="testing-actions">Testing Actions</h2>

Actions are just simple classes that have one
specific job. They are a great way to organize
your code, and separate your logic from your
controllers to keep them clean. But how do you
test them?

Let's start again from the outside. First, we want
to test that our action is called when hitting a
specific endpoint.

```php
it('calls add-product-to-user action', function () {
    // Assert
    $this->mock(AddProductToUserAction::class)
        ->shouldReceive('handle')
        ->atLeast()->once();

    // Arrange
    $product = Product::factory()->create();
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    // Act
    $this->post("purchase/$user->id/$product->i");
});
```

We can do this by mocking our action class and
expecting that the handle method is called. But,
again, we are here not interested in what our
action does; we want to make sure it is called
when we hit our purchase controller.

To make this work, we must ensure that the
container resolves our action.

```php
class PurchaseController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(User $user, Product $product): void
    {
        app(AddProductToUserAction::class->handle($user, $product);

        // Send purchase success email, etc.
    }
}
```

Then we can also test the action itself. Like a
job, we call the `handle` method to trigger the
action.

```php
it('adds product to user', function () {
    // Arrange
    $product = Product::factory()->create();
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    // Act
    (new AddProductToUserAction())->handle($user, $product);

    // Assert
    expect($user->products)
        ->toHaveCount(1)
        ->first()->id->toEqual($product->id);
});
```

<h2 id="testing-commands">Testing Commands</h2>

Commands, similar to actions or jobs, can be tested by triggering them directly. This is a great way to test the logic of your command.

```php
it('merges two accounts', function () {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    $userToBeMerged = User::factory()->create();

    // Act
    $this->artisan(MergeAccountsCommand::class, [
        'userId' => $user->id,
        'userToBeMergedId' => $userToBeMerged->id,
    ]);

    // Assert
    $this->assertDatabaseCount(User::class, 1);
    $this->assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
        'id' => $user->id,
        'name' => $user->name,
        'email' => $user->email,
    ]);
});
```

Most interesting is the `artisan` method, which we can call in any Laravel test. It will trigger the command and run it. We can pass the arguments and options to the command as an array. The rest is very similar to other tests.

But there are some more things we can do with commands. We can also expect output of a command like questions or information messages.

```php
it('asks for user ids', function() {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    $userToBeMerged = User::factory()->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->artisan(MergeAccountsCommand::class)
        ->expectsQuestion('Please provide the user ID of the user you want to keep', $user->id)
        ->expectsQuestion('Please provide the user ID of the user you want to merge', $userToBeMerged->id)
        ->expectsOutput('Accounts merged successfully')
        ->assertSuccessful();
});
```

As you can see in the example above, this is very useful for testing commands that ask for user input. We can also expect output and make sure the command was successful, which means an exit code of 0.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Learn more about testing commands on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/console-tests#main-content">official docs</a>. </div>

<h2 id="testing-middlewares">Testing Middlewares</h2>

A Middleware is always connected to a request, so I like to test the whole request instead of the isolated middleware.

In our example, we have an `archive page` and first test the page's content.

```php
it('shows archived products', function () {
    // Arrange
    $product = Product::factory()->create();
    $archivedProduct = Product::factory()->archived()->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->get(action(PageArchiveController::class))
        ->assertSeeText($archivedProduct->title)
        ->assertDontSeeText($product->title);
});
```

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> Instead of providing the string to the route "get" method manually, I'm using the "action" helper, which gets the route of a controller.</div>

But we also attached a middleware to this route to check if the `archive feature is enabled`. If not, we will return a 404.

```php
it('returns 404 when archive feature disabled', function() {
   // Arrange
    Feature::define('archive', false);

   // Act & Assert
    $this->get(action(PageArchiveController::class))
        ->assertNotFound();
});
```

As you can see, we do not test the middleware in isolation but the whole request and desired outcome.

<h2 id="testing-file-uploads">Testing File Uploads</h2>

Similar to testing mails, notifications, or jobs, we can also test file uploads with the help of a facade.

```php
it('uploads CSV file', function () {
// Arrange
Storage::fake('uploads');
$file = UploadedFile::fake()->image('statistics.csv');

    // Act
    $this->post(action(CsvUploadController::class), [
        'file' => $file,
    ])->assertOk();

    // Assert
    Storage::disk('uploads')->assertExists($file->hashName());
});
```

The `fake` method of the `Storage` facade makes sure we do not store any files on our real storage disks. The facade also provides handy assertion helpers like `assertExists`, to make sure the file was uploaded.

<h2 id="testing-exceptions">Testing
Exceptions</h2>

Sometimes it is a good thing when an exception is
thrown because we intentionally want to stop the
execution of our code. We can test that too.

```php
it('stops if at least one account not found', function () {
    // Act
    $this->artisan(MergeAccountsCommand::class, [
        'userId' => 1,
        'userToBeMergedId' => 2,
    ]);
})->throws(ModelNotFoundException::class);
```

We can chain the `throws` method to our test in
PEST. This will make sure that the exception is
thrown.

<h2 id="testing-units">Testing Units (Unit
Tests)</h2>

Unit tests are great for testing small pieces of
code, like a single method. No other dependencies
are involved. This makes them very fast and easy
to write.

Our example is about a data object. It contains a
method that creates a new instance from an a
webhook payload.

```php
class UserData
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $email,
        public string $name,
        public string $country,
    )
    {}

    public static function fromWebhookPayload(array $webhookCallData): UserData
    {
        return new self(
            $webhookCallData['client_email'],
            $webhookCallData['client_name'],
            $webhookCallData['client_country'],
        );
    }
}
```

In the corresponding test, we only test what this
method returns.

```php
it('creates UserData object from paddle webhook call', function () {
    // Arrange
    $payload = [
      'client_email' => 'test@test.at',
      'client_name' => 'Christoph Rumpel',
      'client_country' => 'AT',
    ];

    // Act
    $userData = UserData::fromWebhookPayload($payload);

    // Assert
    expect($userData)
        ->email->toBe('test@test.at')
        ->name->toBe('Christoph Rumpel')
        ->country->toBe('AT');
});
```

<h2 id="faking-http-calls">Faking HTTP Calls</h2>

Sometimes you need to make HTTP calls in your
application. This could be to fetch data from an
external API or to send data to another service.
You often want to fake these calls in your tests so you do not have to rely on an external service.

```php
it('import product', function () {
    // Arrange
    Http::fake();

    // Act & Assert
    // ...
});
```

The `fake` method on the `HTTP` facade will ensure no real call is made and that the response is always a `200` status code.

But you can be more specific too. For example, we are testing an action that fetches data from an external API and saves it to the database.

```php
it('imports product', function() {
    // Arrange
    Http::fake([
        'https://christoph-rumpel.com/import' => Http::response([
            'title' => 'My new product',
            'description' => 'This is a description',
        ]),
    ]);
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    // Act
    (new ImportProductAction)->handle($user);

    // Assert
    $this->assertDatabaseHas(Product::class, [
        'title' => 'My new product',
        'description' => 'This is a description',
    ]);
});
```

<h2 id="testing-http-calls">Testing HTTP Calls</h2>

Next to faking HTTP calls, you can also test if a specific call was made. This is useful when you want to ensure that your code makes the right calls.

```php
it('make the right call', function () {
    // Arrange
    Http::fake();
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    // Act
    (new ImportProductAction)->handle($user);

    // Assert
    Http::assertSent(function ($request) {
        return $request->url() === 'https://christoph-rumpel.com/import'
            && $request['accessToken'] === '123456';
    });
});
```

<div class="blognote"><strong>Reference:</strong> Learn more about faking HTTP calls on the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/http-client#inspecting-requests">official docs</a>. </div>

<h2 id="mocking-dependencies">Mocking
Dependencies</h2>

When working with code with dependencies, it can
be helpful to mock them. This will let you
concentrate on the logic of your code and not on
the dependencies. This also
means `mocking can be useful for any kind of tests`.

We already did that when testing
our [action classes](#testing-actions), but this
works with any dependency. In the following
example, we have a controller with two
dependencies: a payment provider and a mailer.

```php
class PaymentController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(PaymentProvider $paymentProvider, Mailer $mailer)
    {
        $paymentProvider->handle();

        $mailer->to(auth()->user())->send(new PaymentSuccessfulMail);
    }
}
```

In our test, we want to focus on testing that the
correct email is being sent. That's why we can
mock the payment provider and expect the `handle`
method to be called. As a result, our test will
not fail, even though the actual payment provider
is never called.

```php
it('sends payment successful mail', function () {
    // Arrange
    Mail::fake();

    // Expect
    $this->mock(PaymentProvider::class)
        ->shouldReceive('handle')
        ->once();

    // Act
    $this->post('payment');

    // Assert
    Mail::assertSent(PaymentSuccessfulMail::class);
});
```

## Conclusion

Being aware of the different types of tests and how to write them is a great skill to have. It will help you write better code and make sure that your application is working as expected.
