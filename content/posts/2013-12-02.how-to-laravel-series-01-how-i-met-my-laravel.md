<h2>Intro</h2>

If you already know me from <a title="Twitter Christoph Rumpel" href="https://twitter.com/christophrumpel">Twitter</a>, then you probably have noticed that I am a big fan of the PHP framework Laravel by Taylor Otwell.<br />
I wanted to learn Ruby a year ago because I wasn’t satisfied with PHP anymore and thought it was time to check out a new language. After two weeks of fun, while diving into Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I started a new job, and I had to deal with PHP again =) Some friends told me to look at Laravel, which I did. I immediately fall in love with this fantastic framework; it has been my PHP framework of choice since then.
<h2>Why Laravel</h2>

<blockquote>There are many ORM solutions out there, but none as Eloquent as… well Eloquent (Dayle Rees)</blockquote>

There are so many reasons that I could fill the whole article with information about that. Additionally, I don’t want to write the same stuff here that you will find in so many other articles out there about Laravel. But to be safe, I will mention some main features.
`Migration` - An excellent version control system for your database schema, as you might know from Ruby on Rails. I wouldn’t want to work without such a system anymore.
<span class="font-bold">Composer</span> - Laravel is using Composer,  a PHP dependency manager,  to install and update its dependencies. Besides, it used to include third-party packages in your application. As a result, it has never been easier to manage your code.
<span class="font-bold">Artisan</span> - This is the name of the Laravel command-line interface, which provides dozens of commands for your daily application work. This is one of my favorite features because it makes working with Laravel super fast.
<span class="font-bold">Eloquent</span> - This is the ORM solution that lets you interact with your database through PHP objects. This is damn powerful and easy to use.
<span class="font-bold">Testing</span> - Laravel is built with testing in mind, and testing with PHPUnit is already included. How cool is that, right?
And there is a lot more!
